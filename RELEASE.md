# Release

Male sure you have ios and/or android platforms installed. If you are not sure go back to [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Android

### Get and save licence key

<https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/186113?hl=en>

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore <my-release-key.keystore> -alias <alias_name> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Change `<my-release-key.keystore>` and `<alias_name>` accordingly also in the `release.sh` file:

```
ANDROID_ZIPALIGN="/path/to/Android/sdk/build-tools/21.1.2/zipalign"
ANDROID_KEY_PATH="/path/to/keystore/my-release-key.keystore"
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS="alias_name"
```

### Keyboard adjustment

Some Android versions can have a problem when the keyboard pops up (little hiccup of the app). If it the case on your app it can be prevented:

Open ```platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml``` and change ```android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"``` into ```android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustNothing"```.

### Build PROD APKs
